      <h2 class="title">How to Make the Perfect Cup of Coffee</h2>
      <p class="content">Making the perfect cup of coffee is a matter of personal preference, but here are some basic steps to get you started. 

1. Start with fresh, high-quality coffee beans. A good rule of thumb is to use two tablespoons of ground coffee for every six ounces of water. 

2. Bring fresh, cold water to a boil in a pot or a kettle.

3. Once the water is boiling, pour it into a French press or filter and let it sit for a few minutes to reach its optimal temperature of 195-205°F.

4. Add the ground coffee into your French press or filter and give it a light stir.

5. Let the coffee steep for 3-4 minutes.

6. Once the steep time is up, press down the French press plunger or filter the coffee from the pot.

7. Pour the coffee into a mug and add milk, sugar, or any other desired ingredients.

8. Enjoy your freshly brewed cup of coffee!</p>
